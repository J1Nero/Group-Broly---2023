# Iteration 3 contents

### Throughout our third iteration we aimed to finalize our project and assess problems. <br /> We did this by creating numerous documents to help us point out and analyse any problems.

## Risk Register

We created a risk register table to identify any potential risks in the project. <br />
We did this by creating a table that lists risks, grades them, then assesses how to mitigate them.

## User acceptance testing

We did user acceptance testing to identify problems within the website. <br />
Doing this allowed the group to find underlying problems for users in the website, ensuring they will not make it to the final product.

## Meeting report 2

We created a meeting report to inform our stakeholders of the progress made so far in iteration 3. <br />
This allowed us to improve our communication with the stakeholders, aswell as manage our time better in the future.

## Progress report 2

We created a progress report to inform our stakeholders of the progress made so far in iteration 3. <br />
This allowed us to highlight out the groups progress, strengths, weaknesses, and achievements throughout the iteration.
