# Iteration 2 contents

### Throughout our second iteration we aimed to plan out the project. <br /> We did this by creating numerous documents to help us plan out the requirements of our project.

## Resource needs

We created a resource needs table to allow us to visualise the resouce consumption for each task. <br />
We did this by creating a table and adding every task that would require group resources to complete, measuring them in terms of time and price.

## Gantt chart

We created a gantt chart to visualise deadlines for our project. <br />
This enabled the group to designate tasks and manage our time easier, leading to a smooth ride to the goal of the project.

## Meeting report 2

We created a meeting report to inform our stakeholders of the progress made so far in iteration 2. <br />
This allowed us to improve our communication with the stakeholders, aswell as manage our time better in the future.

## Progress report 2

We created a progress report to inform our stakeholders of the progress made so far in iteration 2. <br />
This allowed us to highlight out the groups progress, strengths, weaknesses, and achievements throughout the iteration.
