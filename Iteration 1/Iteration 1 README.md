# Iteration 1 contents

### Throughout our first iteration we aimed to set up the project for success. <br /> We did this by creating numerous documents to help us visualise the direction and future of our project.

## Stakeholder register

We created a stakeholder register to allow us to visualise our roles in the project. <br />
We did this by creating a table that states the role, power, and requirements of each group member.

## Meeting report 1

We created a meeting report to inform our stakeholders of the progress made so far in iteration 1. <br />
This allowed us to improve our communication with the stakeholders, aswell as manage our time better in the future.

## Persona's (x3)

We created three persona's to represent potential stakeholders. <br />
This enabled the group to identify our potential target audience, and figure out strategies we could use for marketing.

## Persona reviews (x3)

We created one persona review for each persona. <br />
This enabled the group to identify our potential target audience, and figure out strategies we could use for marketing and future development of our product. 

## Progress report 1

We created a progress report to inform our stakeholders of the progress made so far in iteration 1. <br />
This allowed us to highlight out the groups progress, strengths, weaknesses, and achievements throughout the iteration.
